Features:

1. Has tolerance for categorical features

2. Parameters for limiting the depth, number of leaves and minimum number of training examples in a node are available and can be tuned to achieve optimal bias-variance tradeoff.


How to use:

Step I: Clone the repository

Step II: Import the DecisionTreeClassifier class from DecisionTreeClassifier.py

Step III: Create an instance of the DecisionTreeClassifier class and call the fit method to train your model

Step IV: Make predictions on new data by calling the predict method
